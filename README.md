# Tweets Credibility Study

## Executive Summary

Twitter has emerged as a popular platform for educators to share and exchange information, ideas, and resources. However, the credibility of information shared on Twitter has been a topic of debate.

### Key Points

1. **Prolific Twitter Users in Education Sector:** Majority of prolific Twitter users in education are sports-related and unverified, rendering original posts less credible.
2. **Influencers and Retweets:** Many highly retweeted accounts in education are unrelated social media influencers, still not credible for educational information.
3. **Influence Scoring:** Most top influential Twitter users are verified, including a notable proportion of political entities, indicating credibility.
4. **Geographical Analysis:** Most tweets come from the US, serving as a timely public opinion platform for regional education-related events.
5. **Account Verification and Uniqueness:** Verified education entities share similar tweets, while government accounts tend to have unique tweets; higher uniqueness does not always indicate credibility.

### Conclusion

Twitter is a valuable but not wholly credible source for education due to the dilution of credible information by unrelated posts and retweets. Verified accounts in the education sector can generally be considered more credible.
